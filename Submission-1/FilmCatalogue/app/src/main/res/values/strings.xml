    <item>A Star Is Born is a 2018 American musical romantic drama film produced and directed by
                Bradley Cooper and written by Eric Roth, Cooper and Will Fetters. It stars Cooper, Lady Gaga, Dave Chappelle,
                Andrew Dice Clay, and Sam Elliott, and follows a hard-drinking musician (Cooper) who discovers and falls in
                love with a young singer (Gaga). It is the third remake of the original 1937 film, after the 1954 musical and the 1976 musical.
                Talks of a remake of A Star Is Born began in 2011, with Clint Eastwood attached to direct and Beyoncé set to star.
                The film was in development hell for several years with various actors approached to co-star,
                including Christian Bale, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Will Smith, and Tom Cruise. In March 2016, Cooper signed on to star
                and direct, and Lady Gaga joined the cast in August 2016. Principal photography began at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts
                Festival in April 2017. A Star Is Born premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2018,
                and was theatrically released in the United States on October 5, 2018, by Warner Bros. It was a critical and commercial success,
                grossing over $434 million worldwide and receiving praise for Cooper, Gaga, and Elliott\'s performances and Cooper\'s direction,
                as well as the screenplay, cinematography and music. It was chosen by both the National Board of Review and American Film Institute
                as one of the Top 10 Films of 2018.</item>
        <item>Aquaman is a 2018 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Distributed by Warner Bros.
                Pictures, it is the sixth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film was directed by James Wan, from a screenplay by David
                Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall and stars Jason Momoa as Aquaman, with Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph
                Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Nicole Kidman in supporting roles. In the film, Aquaman sets out to lead the underwater
                kingdom of Atlantis, replacing his half-brother, King Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.</item>
        <item>Avengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by
                Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012\'s The Avengers and 2015\'s Avengers:
                Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, written by
                Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo,
                Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen,
                Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film,
                the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from collecting the six all-powerful Infinity Stones as part
                of his quest to kill half of all life in the universe.</item>
        <item>Bird Box can be viewed as one of the most intelligent movies in the current climate. It is a cleverly disguised science fiction film
                where art imitates life. The viewer is brought along a metaphorical path submerged into the depths of ignorance as forced behavior.
                Bird Box sensitively tackles the question of mental health in society. It delves into how it is perceived from those directly affected,
                to those who view it and how those attitudes are communicated. The movie suggests a split in society, an \‘us and them\’ situation.
                And one wonders whether the film would have been such a roaring success if these themes had been addressed more directly within its
                narrative. Through clever symbolism, director Susanne Bier (The Night Manager) subtly gets her point across. In Bird Box, we are told
                an unseen force has the power to cause people who stare towards it to become unbalanced and overwhelmed with the suggestion of suicide.
                This in turn leads to the protagonist and main characters of the story wearing blindfolds in public to remain unaffected.</item>
        <item>Bohemian Rhapsody is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band\'s 1975 album A Night at
                the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage,
                a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre. Upon its release as a
                single, \'Bohemian Rhapsody\' became a commercial success, topping the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million
                copies by the end of January 1976. It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released
                following Mercury\'s death, eventually becoming the UK\'s third-best-selling single of all time. It is also the only song to be the
                UK Christmas number one twice by the same artist. It topped the charts in several other markets as well, including Canada, Australia,
                New Zealand, Ireland, and The Netherlands, later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time selling over six million
                copies worldwide. In the United States, the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976, but returned to the chart in 1992 after
                being used in the film Wayne\'s World and reached a new peak of number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The release of the film of the
                same name in 2018 resulted in renewed popularity and chart success worldwide for the song.</item>
        <item>Bumblebee is a 2018 American science fiction action film centered on the Transformers character of the same name. It is the
                sixth installment of the live-action Transformers film series. Developed as a spin-off and prequel, it was later declared a reboot
                of the franchise. Directed by Travis Knight and written by Christina Hodson, the film stars Hailee Steinfeld, John Cena, Jorge
                Lendeborg Jr., John Ortiz, Jason Drucker, and Pamela Adlon and stars Dylan O\'Brien (as the title character), Angela Bassett,
                Justin Theroux, and Peter Cullen in voice roles. It was Knight\'s first live-action film, as well as the first live-action
                Transformers film not to be directed by Michael Bay, who instead acts as a producer. Principal photography on the film began on
                July 31, 2017, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California.</item>
        <item>Creed II is a 2018 American sports drama film directed by Steven Caple Jr., and written by Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor,
                from a story by Sascha Penn and Cheo Hodari Coker. A sequel to Creed (2015) and the eighth installment in the Rocky film series,
                it stars Michael B. Jordan, Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Dolph Lundgren, Florian Munteanu, Wood Harris, and Phylicia Rashad.
                Creed writer-director Ryan Coogler serves as an executive producer on the film. The film follows a fight over 33 years in the making,
                as Adonis Creed meets a new adversary in the ring: Viktor Drago, son of Ivan Drago, the powerful athlete who killed Adonis\'
                father Apollo Creed in 1985\'s Rocky IV. A Creed sequel was confirmed in January 2016, although due to both Coogler and Jordan\'s
                involvement in Black Panther, the film was delayed, with Coogler ultimately being replaced by Caple. Stallone completed the script
                in July 2017 and announced Lundgren would be reprising his role as Drago, and filming began in Philadelphia in March 2018,
                lasting through June.</item>
        <item>Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created

                1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and later in issues
                of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a
                disfigured mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known
                as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the fourth wall for humorous
                effect and running gags.</item>
